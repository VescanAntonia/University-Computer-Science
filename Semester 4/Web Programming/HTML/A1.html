			<h4> <b> Curiosities about Scotland </b> </h4>
			<p>  &nbsp;Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It borders England to the south, and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea to the east, and the North Channel and the Irish Sea to the southwest. In addition to the part on the island of Great Britain, the country consists of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles⁠ and the Hebrides⁠.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;The name "Scotland" comes from Scoti⁠, the Latin name of the Gaels⁠. The Late Latin word Scotland ("Land of the Gaels") was originally used in reference to Ireland. As late as the 11th century, the name Scotland was used to refer to the (predominantly Gaelic-speaking) Scottish territory north of the River Forth⁠, alongside the names Albania or Albany, both derived from the Gaelic term Alba. The use of words from the Scotland family to encompass all that is Scotland today became common only in the Late Middle Ages<b>[1]</b>.<br><br></p>
